### 1. INTRODUCTION
##### Alzheimer's Disease:
Alzheimer's Disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory
and thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.
Symptoms:
Requires a Medical diagnosis
Memory Loss and confusion are the main symptoms.
People may experience:
* Cognitive Behavioural
* Mood
* Psychological
* Inability to combine muscle
* movements, jumbled speech, or loss of appetite.
* 
It is the cause of 60-70% of cases of dementia.
Experts haven't determined a single cause of Alzheimer's disease but they identified certain risk
factors, including:
*  Age: Most people who develop Alzheimer's disease are 65 years of age or older.
* Family History: If you have an immediate family member who has developed the
condition, you're more likely to get it.
* Genetics: Certain genes have been linked to Alzheimer's disease.

### 2. LITERATURE SURVEY
##### Stages of Alzheimer’s Disease:
Stage 1. There are no symptoms at this stage but there might be an early diagnosis based on
family history.
Stage 2. The earliest symptoms appear, such as forgetfulness.
Stage 3. Mild physical and mental impairments appear, such as reduced memory and
concentration. These may only be noticeable by someone very close to the
person.
Stage 4. Alzheimer’s is often diagnosed at this stage, but it’s still considered mild. Memory
loss and the inability to perform everyday tasks is evident.
Stage 5. Moderate to severe symptoms require help from loved ones or caregivers.
Stage 6. At this stage, a person with Alzheimer’s may need help with basic tasks, such as
eating and putting on clothes.
Stage 7. This is the most severe and final stage of Alzheimer’s. There may be a loss of
speech and facial expressions.
Medical Diagnosis Procedures:
